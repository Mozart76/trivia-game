## 🚀 **Next Steps to Upload to GitHub:**

### **Step 1: Create GitHub Repository**

   - Visit [github.com](https://github.com)
   - Sign in to your account

2. **Create New Repository**
   - Click the "+" icon in the top right

   - **Repository name**: `trivia-game` (or your preferred name)
   - **Description**: "Browser-based trivia game with login system"
   - **Visibility**: Choose Public or Private
   - **⚠️ IMPORTANT**: Do NOT check "Add a README file" (you already have one)
   - **⚠️ IMPORTANT**: Do NOT check "Add .gitignore" (you already have one)
   - Click "Create repository"

### **Step 2: Connect and Push to GitHub**

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you commands. Use these:

```bash
# Add the remote repository (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/trivia-game.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### **Step 3: Verify Upload**

   - You should see all folders:
     - ✅ `server/` folder
     - ✅ `src/` folder  
     - ✅ `public/` folder
     - ✅ All configuration files

2. **Check Folder Structure**
   - Click on each folder to verify contents
   - All files should be visible

## 🔧 **If You Have Issues:**

# Remove existing remote and add new one
git remote remove origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/trivia-game.git
git push -u origin main
```

### **Problem: "Authentication failed"**
